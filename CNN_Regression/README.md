# Deep Learning and Regression 

This repository contains two deep learning projects using **TensorFlow/Keras**:

1. **Age Prediction** üë∂üèªüëµüèª: Train a CNN-based regression model on the **UTKFace dataset** to predict a person's age from facial images.
2. **Home Price Prediction** üè†üí∞: Train a CNN-based regression model using multiple house images to predict home prices.

## Project 1: Age Prediction üë∂üèªüëµüèª

The goal of this project is to predict the **age** of a person using the **UTKFace dataset**, which contains **23,000 aligned facial images** with age labels.

### Steps
1. **Dataset Preparation**: 
- Download the UTKFace dataset from **Kaggle**.
- Load and analyze the **23,000 images**, removing corrupted or unnecessary samples.

2. **Data Augmentation**: 
- Apply **horizontal flipping** to improve model generalization.

3. **Model Training**: 
- Utilize **Transfer Learning** with a pretrained **CNN** (**ResNet50**).
- **Freeze layers** to retain pre-learned features.
- Add **Dropout layers** to prevent overfitting.
- Train the model using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** as the loss function.


4. **Evaluation**: 
- **Loss Curve Analysis**: Track **MAE** during training.
   
     <img src= "Age_Prediction/download (3).png" width = "400" >

- **Sample Inference**: Predict ages on test images.

- **Evaluation Table**:

     | **Metric**       | **Training** | **Validation** |
     |-------------------|--------------|----------------|
     | **Loss**          | 0.1979       | 0.1952        |

     These evaluation metrics provide a detailed view of the model's overall performance during training and validation phases.

5. **WandB Integration**:  
- The training process is connected to **Weights & Biases (WandB)** for tracking and evaluation.
     
     <img src= "Age_Prediction/Untitled.png" width = "500" >

6. **Inference**:
- Load a **person‚Äôs face image**.
- Preprocess the image.
- Pass it through the trained model to predict age.

## Project 2: Home Prices Prediction üè†üí∞

This project builds a deep learning regression model using **multiple images per home** to estimate property prices.

### Steps
1. **Dataset Preparation**: 
- Use the dataset structure from **PyImageSearch** to process home images.
- Each home consists of **4 images**:
  - **Bedroom**
  - **Frontal View**
  - **Kitchen**
  - **Living Room**
- Labels correspond to **property prices**.


2. **Model Architecture**: 

- Use **EfficientNetB0** for feature extraction.
- Process each image **independently** before merging representations.
- Fully connected layers output the **predicted price**.

3. **Training**:

- Use **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** as the loss function.
- Apply **Dropout layers** for regularization.
- Fine-tune learning rates for better accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**: 
- Generate a **loss** curve.

   <img src= "House_Price_Prediction/download.png" width = "400" >

- Perform inference with test images.
- **Evaluation Table**:

  | **Metric**       | **Training** | **Validation** | 
  |-------------------|--------------|----------------|
  | **Loss**          | 330264.1875       | 270031.0625         | 

  These evaluation metrics provide a detailed view of the model's overall performance during training and validation phases.

4. **Inference**:
- Provide **4 images** of a home to the trained model.
- Predict and display the estimated house price.
